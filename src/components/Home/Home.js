          2000 years since the last sunrise, a symbol of hope resurfaces in the
          vast wastelands of Earth.

        <Paragraph>
          Arun Owondo is a scavenger, though not by choice and not for long. A
          band of reclusive Hillfolk have imprisoned him for wearing their
          prized possession: a pair of gloves that can wield cosmic dark energy.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          If Arun is innocent, theyâ€™ll need his help. The Hillfolk must embark
          on finding a lost companion and overthrowing the self-proclaimed God
          who destroyed the world, leaving it shrouded, frozen in a timeless
          time.
